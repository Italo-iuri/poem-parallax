            <p>You may write me down in history <br>
                With your bitter, twisted lies, <br>
                You may trod me in the very dirt <br>
                But still, like dust, I'll rise. <br>

                Does my sassiness upset you? <br>
                Why are you beset with gloom? <br>
                'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells <br>
                Pumping in my living room.

            <p>Just like moons and like suns,  <br>
                With the certainty of tides,  <br>
                Just like hopes springing high,  <br>
                Still I'll rise.  <br>

                Did you want to see me broken?  <br>
                Bowed head and lowered eyes?  <br>
                Shoulders falling down like teardrops,  <br>
                Weakened by my soulful cries?

            <p>Does my haughtiness offend you?  <br>
                Don't you take it awful hard  <br>
                'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines  <br>
                Diggin' in my own backyard.  <br>

                You may shoot me with your words,  <br>
                You may cut me with your eyes,  <br>
                You may kill me with your hatefulness,  <br>
                But still, like air, I'll rise.

            <p>Does my sexiness upset you?  <br>
                Does it come as a surprise  <br>
                That I dance like I've got diamonds  <br>
                At the meeting of my thighs?  <br>
                Out of the huts of history's shame  <br>
                I rise  <br>
                Up from a past that's rooted in pain  <br>
                I rise  <br>
                I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,  <br>
                Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.

            <p>Leaving behind nights of terror and fear  <br>
                I rise  <br>
                Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear  <br>
                I rise  <br>
                Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,  <br>
                I am the dream and the hope of the slave.  <br>
                I rise  <br>
                I rise  <br>
                I rise.
